					<h3>EXHIBITION 'DOL'</h3>
					<h3>BABY'S FIRST BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION IN KOREA</h3>
					<br/>
					<h4>This exhibition will show a set of beautiful Korean traditional dress for the one-year-old babies for boys and girls along with a table for ‘Doljabee’ ceremony.</h4>
					<h4>‘Dol’ is the best known of the Korean birthday celebrations. It is also representing very unique and authentic Korean culture.  When a child lived to be a year old, parents are celebrating their joyous occasion with their family and friends. ‘Doljabee’ ceremony is the main celebration of ‘Dol’. A table is prepared with a large spool of thread, a brush, a Korean calligraphy set, a pencil, a book, money and a bow and arrow for boys or a needle, ruler and pair of scissors for girls. Then the baby picks up one item from the table that attracts him or her. The item that the child picks up is said to predict the child’s future. </h4>
