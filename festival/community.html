                        <p>Gilnori is a Parade that is taken prior before a festival, giving the locals an insight of what is to come when visiting the festival, but also Gilnori is done to appeal to the locals who haven’t heard of the festival, to give
                            them an invitation to come forth and to get to know a little bit about us and what we stand for. </p>
                        <p>We are not holding back. We are making our own version of Gilnori. We are highly inspired by the traditional ways of Gilnori. However, it is time to put our unique twist on it! The music played will be composed with traditional
                            music and electronic music. The music has been carefully selected, knowing it will be heard by many people of all ages. It will have a tasteful taste that will be easy to enjoy to.We are moving a little bit away from the traditional
                            Korean style of Gilnori and heading more towards the Morden style aspect into our work, incorporating the two styles together, to bring something to remember, but for all generations to appeal to our parade. </p>

                        <p>HAPKIDO is a uniquely comprehensive ancient Korean art that is gaining a huge following around the world as an incredibly practical self-defence system. This is because Hapkido techniques do not require strength and, in conflict
                            situations, they allow the defender to gain complete control with minimal effort and without aggression or injuries to the attacker. The art of Hapkido has the most varied types of techniques and offers extensive training in
                            many disciplines, including correct breathing techniques, kicking techniques, pressure points, joint-locking, submissions, throwing techniques, weaponry (including the long staff, sword, cane, fan, short staff, middle staff,
                            belt and rope), and falling techniques that are vital for self-protection in real-life situations. </p>

                        <p>Korean cuisine is largely based on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice" target="_blank">rice</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetable" target="_blank">vegetables</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meat"
                            target="_blank">meats</a>. Traditional Korean meals are noted for the number of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_dish" target="_blank">side dishes</a> that accompany&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steaming"
                            target="_blank">steam-cooked</a> short-grain rice.&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kimchi" target="_blank">Kimchi</a> is almost always served at every meal. Commonly used ingredients include&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_oil"
                            target="_blank">sesame oil</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang" target="_blank">doenjang</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermented_bean_paste" target="_blank">fermented bean paste</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_soy_sauce"

                        <p>South Korean dishes are very different from western Foods in general, as there are a lot of side-dishes being served alongside the main dish. Hence the name ‘slide dishes’. &nbsp;The side dishes are to compliment the main dish.

                    <p>Players aim to keep a heavily weighted shuttlecock (Jaegi) in the air for as long as possible using their bodies except for their hands. (suitable 5+)&nbsp; </p>
                    <p>Jegichagi is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea" target="_blank">Korean</a> traditional outdoor&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game" target="_blank">game</a> in which players kick a paper&nbsp;jegi&nbsp;into
                        the air and attempt to keep it aloft. A&nbsp;jegi&nbsp;is similar to a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttlecock" target="_blank">shuttlecock</a>, and is made from paper wrapped around a small&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coin"
                        target="_blank">coin</a>.In Korea, children usually play alone or with friends in winter seasons, especially on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_New_Year" target="_blank">Lunar New Year</a>. Briefly explaining
                        the rules, the player kicks a&nbsp;jegi&nbsp;up in the air and keeps on kicking to prevent from falling to the ground. In a one-to-one game, a player with the most number of consecutive kicks wins. In a group game, the players
                        stand in a circle, and take turns kicking the Jegi. Players who fail to kick the&nbsp;jegi&nbsp;upon receiving it and let it drop to the ground lose. As a penalty, the loser tosses the&nbsp;jegi&nbsp;at the winner so that he can
                        kick it as he wishes. When the loser catches the&nbsp;jegi&nbsp;back with his hands, the penalty ends and he can rejoin the game.&nbsp;This has developed, and people combined two or three materials and made new ways of playing&nbsp;jegichagi.
                        Though the game was traditionally mostly played in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter" target="_blank">winter</a>, it has become a year-round game.&nbsp; </p>
