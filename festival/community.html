                        <p>‘Gilnori 2017’ will mark the opening of the 2017 Kingston Korean Festival. </p>
                        <p>KBCE is turning Gilnori into a modern parade in collaboration with the location British artists to open the festival! </p>
                        <p>In Korea, artists at local festivals traditionally marched around the village playing and dancing to the music wearing masks prior to their performance. &nbsp;This was to attract and invite people to come along to their show or
                            a festival. &nbsp;This is referred to as ‘Gilnori’ (meaning street performance in Korean) which was essentially a preview to give public an insight of what is to come. </p>
                        <p>So this year KBCE have created our own version of Gilnori. &nbsp;We have been inspired by the traditional form of Gilnori but we are putting our unique twist to it! The parade music has been composed by combining Korean traditional
                            music with modern electronic music and there will be new choreography created just for the parade. </p>
                        <p>We have taken modern interpretation of Korean traditional form of art, incorporating both traditional and modern aspects of both Korean and British culture to create something new and memorable. Gilnori 2017 will be a unique performance
                            for all generation to enjoy.&nbsp; </p>

                        <p>Younger generation of Koreans living in London and the British teenagers have come together to created dance performances, dancing to Korean pop music (known as K-pop). &nbsp;There will be 3 distinctive programmes which will include
                            dance performances along over 10 different K-pop songs.&nbsp; </p>
                        <p>You will probably recognise many of the songs and choreographies as they will be taken from the original dance routine of the some of the very popular K-pop singers. &nbsp;So if you do recognise any of the dance moves, feel free
                            to join in and dance to the beat! </p>
                        <p>Furthermore, we will be introducing Korean traditional music with a modern twist by combining them with the K-pop music. They have been carefully constructed together to create an original piece of its own, creating catchy remixes.
                            This may sound unusual as they are two very different style of music and famous in their own right for different reasons but you will be surprised to hear how great they sound together! &nbsp;There also will be a showcase of
                            choreography specially created to match the rhythms of this new music so watch out for that too! &nbsp;It will be a unique experience for everyone of all age to enjoy. </p>

                        <p>Hapkido is a uniquely comprehensive ancient Korean art that is gaining a huge popularity around the world as a practical skill for self-defence. This is because Hapkido techniques do not require strength and, in conflict situations,
                            they allow the defender to gain complete control with minimal effort without physical violence or injuries to the attacker. The art of Hapkido has the most varied types of techniques and offers extensive training in many disciplines,
                            including correct breathing techniques, kicking techniques, pressure points, joint-locking, submissions, throwing techniques, weaponry (including the long staff, sword, cane, fan, short staff, middle staff, belt and rope),
                            and falling techniques that are vital for self-protection in real-life situations. </p>

                    <p>Players aim to keep a heavily weighted shuttlecock (Jaegi) in the air for as long as possible using their bodies except for their hands. (suitable 5+) </p>
                    <p>Jegichagi is a Korean traditional outdoor game in which players kick a paper jegi into the air and attempt to keep it aloft. A jegi is similar to a shuttlecock, and is made from paper wrapped around a small coin.In Korea, children
                        usually play alone or with friends in winter seasons, especially on Lunar New Year. Briefly explaining the rules, the player kicks a jegi up in the air and keeps on kicking to prevent from falling to the ground. In a one-to-one
                        game, a player with the most number of consecutive kicks wins. In a group game, the players stand in a circle, and take turns kicking the Jegi. Players who fail to kick the jegi upon receiving it and let it drop to the ground lose.
                        As a penalty, the loser tosses the jegi at the winner so that he can kick it as he wishes. When the loser catches the jegi back with his hands, the penalty ends and he can rejoin the game. This has developed, and people combined
                        two or three materials and made new ways of playing jegichagi. Though the game was traditionally mostly played in winter, it has become a year-round game. </p>
